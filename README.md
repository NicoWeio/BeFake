A cool tool for collecting all your friends' photos from BeReal (including RealMojis) without taking any screenshots, opening the app, annoying analytics and much much more!

> [!NOTE]
> This is a fork of [notmarek/BeFake](https://github.com/notmarek/BeFake), which unfortunately has been cease-and-desisted by BeReal.
> I maintain this fork for personal use, so I cannot promise that features besides _login_ and _friends feed_ will work. PRs are welcome either way!

> [!WARNING]
> Because this is primarily for personal use, there _will_ be breaking changes without warning. Make sure to pin the version you are using!
